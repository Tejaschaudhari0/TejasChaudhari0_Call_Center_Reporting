# Call Center Reporting Dashboard Using Power BI

Analyzed employee performance data and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as overall customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, and average speed of answer. Developed a Power BI report visualizing individual and team performance, including the agent’s performance quadrant (average handle time vs. calls answered). Collaborated with management to implement data-driven recommendations that enhanced operational efficiency and team performance.
